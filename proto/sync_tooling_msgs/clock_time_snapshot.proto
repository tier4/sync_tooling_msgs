A graph update containing the time value of a clock.

This message serves as a snapshot of the current time of a given clock.
It serves as a sanity check for whether the clocks in a system are actually synchronized, even
if PTP or PHC2SYS offsets are wrongly reported, incomplete, or missing.

An example of such a scenario is a PTP4L instance that implicitly converts between UTC and TAI.
