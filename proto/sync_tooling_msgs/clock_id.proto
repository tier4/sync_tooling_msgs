/*
A unique identifier for a clock in a distributed system.

A clock is a physical or emulated device that can participate in PTP or PHC2SYS synchronization, and
there can be multiple clocks per physical device. For example, an ECU might have a system clock and
multiple network interfaces with their own clock devices.
