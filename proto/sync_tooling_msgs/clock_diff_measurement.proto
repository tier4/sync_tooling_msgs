A graph update containing a time offset measurement between two clocks.

While there are `ClockMasterUpdate` and `Phc2SysUpdate` which also contain time offset measurements,
this message is for measurements that are done by other means, e.g. by extracting timestamps from
sensor data and comparing it with packet ingress time in the driver.

This kind of measurement can be more inaccurate than those produced by PTP or PHC2SYS directly.
